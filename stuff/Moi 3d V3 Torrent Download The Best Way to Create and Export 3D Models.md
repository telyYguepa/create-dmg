If you want to install Embarcadero RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo Architect with ISO PATCH and FBP Keygen, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the ISO file from the official website[^1^] or from a trusted torrent site[^2^]. The file size is about 6.08 GB.
2. Mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software, such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO.
3. Run the setup.exe file and follow the installation wizard. You will need to enter your serial number and select the components you want to install.
4. After the installation is complete, do not run the program yet. Copy the PATCH.exe file from the FBP folder to the installation directory, usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\19.0\bin.
5. Run the PATCH.exe file as administrator and click on Patch. This will modify some files in the installation directory to bypass the license check.
