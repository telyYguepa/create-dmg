## What to Expect from Conflict: Global Terror
 
Conflict: Global Terror is not a game for the faint of heart. It is a game that requires you to think strategically, manage your resources, and coordinate your team members. You can switch between any of the four squad members at any time, and each one has his own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Bradley is the leader and medic, Foley is the sniper and demolitions expert, Connors is the heavy weapons specialist, and Jones is the stealth operative. You will need to use their skills wisely to overcome the various challenges and enemies that await you.
 
The game features a variety of weapons and equipment that you can use to your advantage. You can pick up enemy weapons, use grenades, mines, C4 explosives, rocket launchers, and more. You can also use binoculars, night vision goggles, thermal goggles, and other gadgets to scout the area and spot enemies. The game also lets you commandeer vehicles such as jeeps, tanks, helicopters, and boats to traverse the terrain and engage in combat.
 
The game's graphics and sound are decent for its time, but they may not impress you by today's standards. The environments are detailed and varied, but they also suffer from some glitches and clipping issues. The character models and animations are realistic, but they also look stiff and unnatural at times. The voice acting and sound effects are good, but they also get repetitive and annoying after a while. The music is fitting for the game's theme, but it also lacks variety and originality.
 
The game's difficulty level is high, but not always fair. The enemy AI is aggressive and relentless, but also dumb and predictable. They will often charge at you in groups or take cover behind destructible objects. They will also sometimes ignore your teammates or shoot at walls. The game's checkpoints are scarce and inconsistent, forcing you to replay long sections of the game if you die or fail an objective. The game's controls are complex and cumbersome, making it hard to switch weapons, use items, or issue commands quickly and smoothly.
